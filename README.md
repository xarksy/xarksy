### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Hello, I am a self-taught developer who loves programming. Repetitive tasks make me boring until I found AutoIt Selenium WebDriver couple years ago. From the moment I clicked the website button by writing a set of script, I knew I was hooked into the software development.
Programming offered an engaging challenge continually learn and improve my skills in building a high-quality software. As the years go by, writing script gets more exciting. These excitements bring lead me to learn more in online course called Dicoding.
